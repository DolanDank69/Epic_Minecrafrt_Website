    <h2>Automatic Wool Farm</h2>
    <p>Above this writing you can see our automatic wool farm. The way that it works is that there is an observer that detects when the grass block in front of it changes to a dirt block.</p>
    <p>When the observer detects that there is a change in the grass block it will send a redstone signal to the dispenser which has sheers in it. The sheers then sheer the sheep. The wool from the sheep then gets sucked into a hopper that moves the wool into a chest where it is ready for collection.</p>

    <h2>Underground Bunker</h2>
    <p>Here we have my friends not so secret underground bunker with a simple but fancy piston door in the side of a hill. It took my friend many hours of mining holes and filling them with tnt so that it was easier and faster to hollow out his underground hole so that he could turn it into a bunker.</p>

    <h2>Enderman Farm</h2>
    <p>Here is our enderman/xp farm where we are able to easily gain enough xp so that we can mend our equipment. Unlike making a farm from a mob spawner where it takes a little bit of time for the mobs to spawn only to drop a minimal amount of xp; the enderman farm is in the end where multiple endermen can spawn extremely quickly.</p>
